# RockPaperScissor

This JavaScript code snippet implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game logic and user interactions are managed through event listeners and DOM manipulation. It starts with initializing the scores for both the user and the computer to zero. DOM elements representing the user's choices (rock, paper, scissors), the result message, and the score displays are selected. The function genCompChoice randomly selects one of the three options for the computer. The drawGame function updates the message element to indicate a draw and changes its background color. The showWinner function updates the score and displays a message indicating whether the user won or lost, with the message's background color changing based on the outcome. The playGame function generates the computer's choice, compares it with the user's choice, determines the outcome, and calls the appropriate function to handle the result. Event listeners are added to each choice element to trigger the game logic when the user makes a selection. This script provides a fully functional Rock-Paper-Scissors game where users can interact with the game through the web interface, see the results, and keep track of their scores.
